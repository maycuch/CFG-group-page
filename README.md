# CFG-group-page: The Anatomy of the Dog
- it is a simple webiste which can be find in `index.html` where we practised what we learn during the CFG Kickstarter course (one weekly evening session over 8 weeks)
- it has 3 separate pages:
  - Homepage with a picture of the dog with 5 clickable buttons
  - Animals page that can direct you to another specific animal's page (Cat, Rabbit, Guinea Pig)
  - Sign Up page - where you can fill up sign up form
 
We worked with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
